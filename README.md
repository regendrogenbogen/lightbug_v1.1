# lightbug v1.1

Source files for a small light following robot based on the Arduino Leonardo design. 
Hardware design was done in Altium Designer and I am not sure how and under which license I am
allowed to share the sorce files, therefor I am only sharing the Gerbers, schematic and
the BOM. 
According to the Arduino website derivates of the design must be shared under the
Creative Commons Attribution Share-Alike license, I hope that is applicable for the non-source
files I am publishing. Also, I am not really sure if this really counts as a derivate because I
just took the default operating circuit for the ATMega32U4 and added my peripherals.
The software is of course completely open, according to the GPL license.

Have fun with the files!

PS: If I did licence anything wrong and I am violating other licenses, please tell me,
I am still learning!
